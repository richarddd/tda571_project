Ball Tanks
----------

Thank you for your interest in our game.
Ball Tanks was made at Chalmers University of Technology as a project for the Simulation Engines course in 2015, the course was a part of the Interaction Design & Technologies Master's programme.

Requirements:
-------------
- Unity v4.6.2f (Personal Edition)
- Any GIT compatible client

Building the Game:
------------------
1 - Clone the GIT repository (located @ https://github.com/richarddd/tda571_project)
2 - Open Unity, and select "Open Project...", then select "Open Another..."
3 - Point Unity to the main project folder on your hard drive (BallTanks\)
4 - Click File->Build & Run to try out the game
5 - You now have everything set up in Unity and you can add/remove/edit files or assets as necessary

For the best experience possible, we recommend running the game at your monitor's native resolution, with the "Fantastic" quality setting.
